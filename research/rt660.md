- **Front/Rear Split**: 28F/27R (some drivers prefer)
- **Pressure Range**: 24-28 PSI for optimal performance
- **Temperature Target**: Lower end of optimal range (150-160°F)

### Track/HPDE Setup
- **Hot Pressure**: 30-32 PSI recommended
- **Alternative**: Some drivers prefer 35 PSI hot
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Aim for even temps across contact patch
- **Starting Point**: 28 PSI hot for shorter sessions, 30-32 PSI for longer

### Heat Cycling
- Benefits from heat cycling for maximum performance
- Can maintain performance through multiple heat cycles
- Designed to heat up quickly with lower temperature ceiling than many competitors

## Wear Characteristics

### Tread Life
- **New Tread Depth**: 7/32"
- **Post-Session Testing**: Maintained 6/32"+ after autocross in 105°F conditions
- **Wear Rate**: Faster than RT615K+ but acceptable for competitive use
- **Longevity vs Performance**: Optimized for maximum grip rather than longevity

### Performance Degradation
- **Worn Performance**: Testing showed worn RT660 was 0.3 seconds faster than new
- **Consistency**: Maintains predictable characteristics as it wears
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Less sensitive to temperature variations when worn

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. RT615K+
- **Grip**: Significantly higher lateral and longitudinal grip
- **Response**: Much better turn-in and steering response
- **Heat Tolerance**: Higher operating temperature range
- **Longevity**: RT615K+ lasts longer, RT660 provides competitive edge
- **Cold Performance**: RT660 vastly superior on first lap

### vs. Bridgestone RE-71R/RE-71RS
- **Single Lap Pace**: RE-71R/RS slightly faster on single laps
- **Consistency**: RT660 more consistent over multiple runs
- **Heat Management**: RT660 better heat tolerance
- **Pinch Performance**: RE-71R better when pinched on narrow wheels

## Solo Spec Coupe Applications

### Class Suitability
- Excellent choice for SCCA Solo Spec Coupe class
- Balances performance with reasonable longevity for club racing
- Quick warm-up characteristics ideal for autocross format
- Predictable handling characteristics important for spec class racing

### Setup Considerations for SSC
- Start with 28 PSI hot for autocross events
- Monitor tire temperatures across contact patch
- Consider 30-32 PSI for longer track sessions
- Heat cycling recommended for maximum competitive performance

## Real-World Solo Spec Coupe Data

*The following data is from actual SSC competition experience and provides critical validation for simulation correlation.*

### Temperature and Warm-Up Characteristics
- **Competitive immediately at ambient temperature** - tire provides good grip from cold start
- **Optimal performance after one run** - reaches peak grip characteristics after initial heat cycle
- **Heat sensitivity**: Can get greasy when hot, which only takes a few runs in succession
- **Heat management critical** for maintaining consistent performance in multi-run events

### Optimal Pressure Settings (SSC Specific)
- **Front**: 31 PSI hot
  - Primary consideration is maintaining even wear on tread blocks
  - Higher pressure needed to prevent excessive shoulder wear with SSC alignment
- **Rear**: 29 PSI hot  
  - Not camber limited in SSC setup
  - 29 PSI optimized for peak grip
  - Slightly overinflated (~1 PSI) to induce rotation characteristics
  - **Note**: 28 PSI likely ideal with unlimited camber availability

### Handling Characteristics
- **Stiff sidewalls** provide very responsive steering input
- **Peaky grip characteristics** - high maximum grip but narrow operating window
- **Abrupt breakaway** - drops off suddenly when tire lets go
- **Sharp limit handling** requires smooth driving technique for optimal performance

### SSC-Specific Performance Notes
- Pressure setup reflects SSC class limitations (camber restrictions, alignment constraints)
- Front pressure primarily wear-management focused rather than pure grip optimization
- Rear pressure tuned for balance between grip and rotation in SSC chassis setup
- Heat management becomes critical in multi-run autocross events typical of SCCA competition

## Real-World User Feedback

### Positive Attributes
- Exceptional dry traction with "sticky" grip
- Precise cornering and confidence-inspiring at the limit
- Quick warm-up characteristics
- Consistent lap times even in high heat
- Predictable behavior when approaching the limit

### Considerations
- Faster wear rate than touring tires
- Requires proper pressure and temperature management
- Performance-oriented compound requires appropriate driving techniques
- Best suited for competitive applications rather than daily driving

## Simulation Correlation Data

### Key Physics Parameters for AC Tuning
- **Optimal Temperature Range**: 150-180°F (65-82°C)
- **Pressure Sensitivity**: Higher sensitivity to pressure changes than street tires
- **Grip Characteristics**: Sharp turn-in, high mid-corner grip, **abrupt breakaway** (not progressive)
- **Heat Generation**: Quick heat-up characteristics, becomes greasy when overheated
- **Wear Model**: Performance improves slightly with initial wear, then gradual degradation

### Recommended AC tyres.ini Correlations
- **Pressure Settings**: 31F/29R PSI hot for SSC (reflects real-world optimal setup)
- **Higher grip coefficients** for lateral and longitudinal forces
- **Sharp falloff characteristics** - low FALLOFF_LEVEL values to simulate abrupt breakaway
- **Temperature model**: Good cold performance, peak after one heat cycle, degradation when overheated
- **Sidewall stiffness**: Higher spring rates and lower flex values to simulate responsive, stiff sidewalls

### SSC-Specific Correlation Points
- **Cold tire performance**: Competitive grip immediately from ambient temperature
- **Heat cycling**: Peak performance after initial warm-up cycle
- **Pressure sensitivity**: Front tire wear-limited, rear grip-optimized
- **Breakaway characteristics**: Sudden loss of grip rather than progressive slide
- **Stiff construction**: Responsive turn-in but narrow operating window at the limit

## Research Gaps and Future Investigation

### Additional Data Needed
- Specific tire construction details (belt angles, compound chemistry)
- More detailed temperature-grip relationship data
- Long-term wear progression characteristics
- Detailed pressure-temperature-grip correlation matrices

### Real-World Validation Opportunities
- Solo Spec Coupe event data collection
- Tire temperature and pressure logging during competition
- Lap time correlation with various setup parameters
- Comparison with actual SSC data for simulation validation
