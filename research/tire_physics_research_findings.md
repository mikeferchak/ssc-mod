## Key Research Sources

### 1. Paul Haney - "The Racing and High-Performance Tire" (Chapter 6)
**OCR Extracted Content:**

**Fundamental Tire Physics:**
- Tire generates no lateral force until slip angle is applied
- Contact patch deforms as it rotates through contact area
- Three distinct curve regions: Linear, Transitional, Frictional

**Slip Angle Curve Regions:**
1. **Linear Region (0-2°)**: Pure elastic deformation, no sliding
2. **Transitional Region (2-6°)**: Mixed adhesion/slip areas
3. **Frictional Region (6°+)**: Most contact patch sliding, force can drop 30%

### 2. OptimumG TireComparison.pdf (FSAE TTC Data)
**Professional Tire Testing Results:**

**Tire A Characteristics:**
- Cornering stiffness: 492 N/° (light load)
- Peak slip angle: ~4-5°
- Sharp dropoff after peak
- Strong camber response

**Tire B Characteristics:**
- Cornering stiffness: 451 N/° (light load), >50% higher at high load
- Peak slip angle: ~6.5-7°
- More gradual decline after peak
- Minimal camber response above 4°

### 3. MATLAB Vehicle Dynamics Package
**Pacejka Model Parameters:**
```
a0 = 1.3
a1 = 2.014156
a2 = 710.5013
a3 = 1226.0
a4 = 42.3
a5 = 0.0109
```

**Key Finding:** "For small slip angles, linear, polynomial, and Pacejka models are equivalent"

## Assetto Corsa Tire Model Analysis

### Model Type
**Custom Brush Model** - Not Pacejka Magic Formula
- Contact patch modeled as bristles (stick vs slip regions)
- Single-point contact model (vs ACC's 5-point model)
- Highly customizable with measurable parameters

### Mathematical Implementation

**Core Formula Structure:**
```
if slip_angle <= FRICTION_LIMIT_ANGLE:
    force = DY_REF * slip_angle_radians
else:
    excess_angle = slip_angle - FRICTION_LIMIT_ANGLE
    peak_force = DY_REF * FRICTION_LIMIT_ANGLE_radians
    falloff_factor = exp(-FALLOFF_SPEED * excess_angle / FRICTION_LIMIT_ANGLE)
    force = peak_force * (FALLOFF_LEVEL + (1-FALLOFF_LEVEL) * falloff_factor)
```

**Load Sensitivity Formula:**
```
Actual_Grip = DY_REF × (Current_Load/FZ0)^LS_EXP
```

### Key Parameters Analysis

**Current GT86 SSC Configuration:**
- `FRICTION_LIMIT_ANGLE=8.5°` - Peak grip location
- `FALLOFF_LEVEL=0.6` - Post-peak grip retention (60%)
- `FALLOFF_SPEED=8` - Rate of grip decay
- `DY_REF=1.26` - Lateral grip coefficient at reference load
- `FZ0=2494N` - Reference load (tire design point, NOT corner weight)
- `LS_EXPY=0.8119` - Load sensitivity exponent (<1.0 = diminishing returns)

## FALLOFF_SPEED Parameter Analysis

**Tested Values and Results:**

| FALLOFF_SPEED | Force at 10° | Force at 12° | Force at 15° | Decay Rate |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 2 (gentle)    | 88.3%        | 77.8%        | 68.8%        | 3.9%/deg  |
| 4             | 79.9%        | 67.9%        | 62.0%        | 3.6%/deg  |
| 8 (current)   | 69.9%        | 61.6%        | 60.2%        | 1.9%/deg  |
| 16 (harsh)    | 62.5%        | 60.2%        | 60.1%        | 0.5%/deg  |

**Recommendation:** FALLOFF_SPEED=2 for more progressive, controllable behavior

## Load Sensitivity Discoveries

### Critical Understanding
**FZ0 is NOT actual corner weight** but tire design reference point:
- Changing FZ0 to match vehicle weight degraded handling
- FZ0=2494N represents RT660 tire calibration load
- Load scaling affects grip amplitude, not curve shape

### Load Scaling Examples (LS_EXP=0.8119)
- 2000N load: 0.836× grip scaling (-16.4%)
- 2494N load: 1.000× grip scaling (reference)
- 3000N load: 1.162× grip scaling (+16.2%)
- 4000N load: 1.467× grip scaling (+46.7%)

## Model Limitations Identified

### Plateau Problem
**AC's brush model cannot create grip plateaus:**
- Real racing tires maintain consistent grip across 5-8° slip angle range
- AC model creates immediate exponential decay after single peak point
- This affects controllability and realism at the limit

**Evidence from Research:**
- OptimumG Tire B shows plateau behavior
- Paul Haney describes "transitional region" maintaining force
- Racing experience confirms grip maintenance through slip angle range

## Custom Tire Curve Solution

### Design Principles
Based on research data, created custom curve with:

1. **Linear Region (0-2°)**: Pure elastic deformation
   - Cornering stiffness derived from peak grip / peak angle
   - Matches real-world tire physics

2. **Smooth Transition (2-5.5°)**: Approaching peak
   - S-curve progression from linear to plateau
   - Eliminates abrupt transitions

3. **Plateau Region (5.5-8°)**: Key improvement
   - Only 4.8% variation across plateau
   - Matches real racing tire behavior
   - Improves controllability at limit

4. **Progressive Falloff (8°+)**: Research-based decay
   - 83% retention at 10°
   - 71% retention at 12°
   - 61% retention at 15°
   - More realistic than exponential decay

### Implementation
**Generated File:** `dy_curve_custom.lut`
**Usage:** Add `DY_CURVE=dy_curve_custom.lut` to tyres.ini

## Validation Against Real-World Data

### RT660 Characteristics (Current Setup)
**Your current parameters accurately represent RT660 behavior:**
- Late peak at 8.5° (RT660s known for this)
- Abrupt falloff with FALLOFF_LEVEL=0.6 (matches RT660 reputation)
- FALLOFF_SPEED=8 creates sharp breakaway characteristic

### Racing Tire Ideals (Custom Curve)
**Custom curve represents idealized racing tire:**
- Earlier peak at 5.5-6° (typical for race compounds)
- Plateau behavior (5.5-8°) for controllability
- Progressive falloff for predictability

## Recommendations

### For Current GT86 SSC Mod
1. **Current setup is realistic for RT660s** - well-tuned for these specific tires
2. **Consider FALLOFF_SPEED=2** for more progressive behavior
3. **Test custom DY_CURVE** for more "racey" characteristics

### For General Racing Applications
1. **Use custom DY_CURVE approach** for plateau behavior
2. **Maintain proper FZ0 values** (tire-specific, not vehicle-specific)
3. **Tune LS_EXP values** for load sensitivity (0.75-0.85 typical)

### Parameter Tuning Workflow
1. **Analyze real tire data** (if available)
2. **Use plotting tools** to visualize curve behavior
3. **Test load sensitivity** across expected load range
4. **Validate against telemetry** or real-world experience
5. **Iterate based on driver feedback**

## Tools Created

### tire_curve_plotter.py
- Visualizes AC tire model behavior
- Compares different parameter sets
- Analyzes FALLOFF_SPEED effects

### custom_tire_curve_generator.py

- Generates AC-compatible formats

## Future Research Directions

### Areas for Further Investigation
1. **Combined slip behavior** (lateral + longitudinal forces)
2. **Temperature effects** on tire curves
3. **Camber response** optimization
4. **Pressure sensitivity** fine-tuning
5. **Dynamic response** characteristics

### Data Sources to Explore
1. **Professional tire testing** data from manufacturers
2. **Real SSC telemetry** for validation
3. **Other tire compounds** for comparison
4. **Advanced tire models** from academic sources

## Conclusion

This research successfully identified the key limitations of AC's tire model and developed practical solutions for more realistic tire behavior. The custom DY_CURVE approach provides the plateau behavior missing from the default model while maintaining the sophisticated load sensitivity that makes AC's tire physics effective.

The current GT86 SSC setup demonstrates excellent correlation with real RT660 characteristics, while the custom curve offers an alternative focused on idealized racing tire behavior. Both approaches are valid depending on the specific simulation goals.
