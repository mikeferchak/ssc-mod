[HEADER]
VERSION=v2022.12.03

[INFO]
SCREEN_NAME=Toyota GT86 SSC

[BASIC]
GRAPHICS_OFFSET=0,-0.475,-0.045		; 3D model position offset relative to car's center of gravity (x,y,z) in meters
GRAPHICS_PITCH_ROTATION=-0.5		; Visual pitch rotation of 3D model (degrees) - does not affect physics
TOTALMASS=1202						; Total vehicle mass in kilograms - includes fuel, driver, all components
INERTIA=1.60,1.20,4.60				; Rotational inertia dimensions (width, height, length) in meters - used to calculate moment of inertia about each axis

[GRAPHICS]
DRIVEREYES=0.359116,1.07184,-0.407793	; Driver's eye position (x,y,z) in meters - defines cockpit camera position
ONBOARD_EXPOSURE=19						; Camera exposure setting for cockpit view (lower = darker)
OUTBOARD_EXPOSURE=31					; Camera exposure setting for external views (lower = darker)
ON_BOARD_PITCH_ANGLE=-3.040853			; Default pitch angle for cockpit camera in degrees
BONNET_CAMERA_POS=0,0.71,0.4			; Hood/bonnet camera position (x,y,z) in meters
BUMPER_CAMERA_POS=0,0.71,1.74			; Bumper camera position (x,y,z) in meters
MIRROR_POSITION=0.0,1.04,-2.0			; Virtual mirror position (x,y,z) - used for rendering mirrors
VIRTUAL_MIRROR_ENABLED=0				; Enable/disable virtual mirror (0=off, 1=on)
USE_ANIMATED_SUSPENSIONS=0				; Enable/disable animated suspension visualization (0=off, 1=on)
SHAKE_MUL=3								; Camera shake multiplier - affects how much camera shakes with car movement
FUEL_LIGHT_MIN_LITERS=7					; Fuel level (liters) at which fuel warning light activates

[CONTROLS]
FFMULT=2.970						; Force feedback multiplier - adjusts strength of FFB effects
STEER_ASSIST=1.000					; Steering assist multiplier - affects steering feel (1.0 = no assist)
STEER_LOCK=450						; Maximum steering wheel rotation from center to lock (degrees) - should match real car
STEER_RATIO=-13.0					; Steering ratio - ratio of steering wheel rotation to front wheel angle (negative for proper direction)
LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO=0.0024		; Linear steering rod ratio - affects steering feel but not actual ratio

[FUEL]
CONSUMPTION=0.0027					; Fuel consumption formula: (rpm * throttle * CONSUMPTION) / 1000 = liters per second
FUEL=10								; Default starting fuel amount in liters
MAX_FUEL=50							; Maximum fuel tank capacity in liters

[FUELTANK]
POSITION=0,-0.10,-1.45				; Fuel tank center position (x,y,z) in meters relative to car CG - affects weight distribution

[RIDE]
PICKUP_FRONT_HEIGHT=-0.285			; Front ride height measurement point vertical offset from CG in meters
PICKUP_REAR_HEIGHT=-0.285			; Rear ride height measurement point vertical offset from CG in meters

[PIT_STOP]
TYRE_CHANGE_TIME_SEC=10				; Time in seconds to change each tire during pit stop
FUEL_LITER_TIME_SEC=0.6				; Time in seconds to refuel 1 liter during pit stop
BODY_REPAIR_TIME_SEC=20				; Time in seconds to repair 10% of body damage during pit stop
ENGINE_REPAIR_TIME_SEC=2			; Time in seconds to repair 10% of engine damage during pit stop
SUSP_REPAIR_TIME_SEC=30				; Time in seconds to repair 10% of suspension damage during pit stop
